# GS2
The original GS2 paper is by [Kotschenreuther (1995)](../literature/plasma/MCF/gyrokinetics/kotschenreuther1995gs2.md), although [Highcock's thesis](../literature/plasma/MCF/gyrokinetics/highcock2012zero-turbulence.md) is a more comprehensive and modern description of the code, its geometry, normalisations, etc.
