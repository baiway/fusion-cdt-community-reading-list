# Gyrokinetic theory
Start with [Howe et al. (2006)](../literature/plasma/MCF/gyrokinetics/howes2006astro-gyrokinetics.md). Appendix A is particularly useful. You may wish to read this in conjuction with [Abel et al. (2013)](../literature/plasma/MCF/gyrokinetics/abel2013multiscale-gyrokinetics.md).

You may find in your reading that authors use the fields $\delta A_\parallel$ and $\delta B_\parallel$ for the magnetic field, this is because...

In gyrokinetic theory it's common to use the Coulomb gauge $\nabla \cdot \mathbf{A} = 0$ whereas in MHD theory you sometimes use...
