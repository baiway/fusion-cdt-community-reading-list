# Get started

## What is this?
A collection of useful resources related to plasma physics, material science and fusion power created by students on the [EPSRC CDT in Fusion Power](https://fusion-cdt.ac.uk/). 

!!! warning
    
    This is very much a work-in-progress.

## Project structure
The repository currently has the following flat-ish structure:
```
fusion-cdt-community-reading-list/docs
├── index.md
├── literature
│   ├── abel2013multiscale-gyrokinetics.md
│   ├── howes2006astro-gyrokinetics.md
│   └── index.md
└── tutorials
    ├── gyrokinetic-theory.md
    └── index.md  
```

The idea is that all literature notes will go in the [`literature`](./literature) folder, and will be discoverable via tags (e.g. `gyrokinetics`, `zonal-flows`, etc.). Longer 'tutorial'-style notes will be stored in the [`tutorials`](./tutorials) folder. These will contain curated notes that aim to guide students through a topic (e.g. read pages 10-50 of paper X, then read chapter 2 of thesis Y, etc.).
